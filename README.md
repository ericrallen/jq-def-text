jQuery Default Text

This simple jQuery plug-in allows you to set default text for textboxes that will 
disappear on focus and return on blur if nothing has been entered in the box.

It is used like this:

$(selector).defaultText({
  def_text: 'Default Text'
});

Future versions will support Text Areas, as well.

Future versions will also support Input Masks.
